# Atomic-Level-Particle-Simulator-With-Newtonian-Mechanics-
Simulates subatomic particles using Newtonian Mechanics.


This simulator simulates motion of electrons, protons and neutrons in a vacuum using Newtonian Mechanics. It is able to simulate formation of various elements, elimination of excess electrons, and is also able to show graphs. [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) is used for displaying the chart upto first 100 seconds.

I have made an arbitrary function for the Name generation (note that the logic behind name generation does not accurately represent that of IUPAC).
